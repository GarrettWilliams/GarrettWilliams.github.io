I am a not very experienced machine learning practioneer with experience in recommender systems, survival analysis and time series analysis. I have an interest in using machine learning and big data techniques to solve challenging real world problems.

I am currently working as a research scientist at Amazon where I work with a team to build models which optimize content the on the Sellers Central homepage. 

Before that I was a data scientist at ASML developing predictive models of machine part failure.

I received an MA in Mathematics from UCSD, an MS in Chemistry from the University of Chicago.
